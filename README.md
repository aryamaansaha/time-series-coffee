# Time Series Analysis
Climate change has impacted the coffee production in Brazil, the world's largest coffee
producer. Arabica, the most popular variety of coffee, is under the risk of declining yield
and quality due to global changes in temperature. Temperatures between 18°C and 22°C is
the ideal climatic condition for arabica coffee production. Agricultural areas with average
annual temperature above 24 °C are found to be unsuitable for Arabica production. 

In this project, we analyze and forecast temperatures in two regions in Brazil with the help of seasonal ARIMA and LSTM models, to obtain some insight on the influence of changing temperatures on the coffee industry.
